title: About Confinement Projects
---


While the confinement tool can be used on any GIS data, a preferred workflow is to use a Confinement Project. A confinement project is simply a managed folder structure with an accompanying XML file. The confinement tools are structured to use this XML file to find data and keep a record of all outputs and analysis for a particular set of confinement data. 

A confinement project is also structured to work with the Riverscapes Analyst Toolbar and Data Warehouse. If data is to be included in this system, then it must be processed as a Confinement Project.

Confinement Projects will copy input data into the project itself. All data within a project uses the Shapefile format. 

Confinement Projects must be set up at the start of processing. There are currently no tools to convert previous results into a confinement project.

To get started, proceed to [Step 1 - Creating a Confinement Project](Create-a-Project).


## Confinement Project Outline
- Project
	- Project MetaData
		- Operator
		- Region

		- DateCreated
	- Inputs
		- **Definition** List of all Inputs used throughought the history of the Project, including
			- Stream Networks
			- Channel Polygons
			- Valley Bottoms
	- Realizations
		- **Definition** A realization is the first step in the Confinement Process, and consists of generating the Raw Confining State and Confining Margins for a set of inputs. 
		- Outputs
			- Raw Confining State
			- ConfiningMargins
		- Analyses
			- **Definition** An Analysis is the processing of the results of a realization. An anaysis is tied to the realization, and there can be any number of analyses of any type for any one realization.
